Current Features:

Crafted Armor Rework: Defense baked into pieces (no penalty for breaking sets), plus new 2-piece mix-and-match bonuses.
Emergency Shield: Chestpieces grant reactive shields with visual feedback showing damage blocked.
Shiny Buff: 2pc bonus making nearby ores sparkle (only slightly beyond torch range), making early mining a little more fun.
Smart Minion Pathfinding: Minions navigate around obstacles using A* pathfinding instead of getting stuck.

Future Features:
- Native Biome Bootstrap (craft basic stations from [i]any[/i] local materials)
