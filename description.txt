Terraria Survival Overhaul enhances the survival RPG experience, by 
increasing the need for bases, making biome specific bases serve a 
functional purpose, encouraging combat, enhancing gear progression, and
making gameplay more authentic (by removing exploits).

Our Goals:
- Make every expedition an adventure with real commitment
- Reward preparation, planning, and skillful play
- Create satisfying tension between risk and reward
- Deepen engagement with Terraria's rich world

Current Features:
- Persistent Player Position: Your character stays where you left them

Coming Soon:

- Enhanced enemy behaviors
- Strategic travel systems

For players who want their victories to feel truly earned.
